  \item
    {\bf System Design:} Designed and built a data recording system for
    real time biological and video signal acquisition. Used PTC Pro
    Engineer to design and print 3D parts as needed. The system
    monitored a force sensor to automatically detect a behavioral task
    and store data using a FIFO buffer.
  \item
    {\bf Supervised Learning (Classification):} Classified forelimb
    extension and flexion movements using spinal cord signals recorded
    in rats. LDA, KNN, SVM, NaiÌˆve Bayes, and Random Forest algorithms
    were tested and compared for their classification performance.
  \item
    {\bf Supervised Learning (Regression):} Forelimb electromyography
    (EMG) signals were predicted from the spinal cord signals in rats.
    Multiple Linear Regression algorithm was used.
  \item
    {\bf Image Processing:} Video images of test subjects (rats)
    analyzed for movement identification. Custom written MATLAB scripts
    were used to read and analyze video recordings frame by frame.
  \item
    {\bf Academic:} Published research papers and presented academic
    work in national and international conferences. Tutored high school,
    undergraduate, and graduate students in summer research and school
    projects.

    Laboratory. Explained the principles of medical instrumentation such
    as, sampling, analog and digital signal processing, filtering and
    noise cancelling.
  \item
    {\bf Laboratory:} Taught how to use data acquisition systems and
    software tools to record and process biophysiological signals, such
    as ECG, EOG, and EMG.
