Experience
----------

2018-2019
:   *Postdoctoral Research Associate,*  NJIT

    * __Project Management:__ Planning and coordination of research activities including distribution of tasks, manufacturing devices, conducting experiments, collecting, analyzing and reporting data.
    * __Data Collection:__ Utilizing NIdaq devices (National Instruments Inc.) to acquire electrophysiological signals in real time. Collecting video images (Allied Vision Inc.) for offline movement analysis.
    * __Data Analysis:__ Offline analysis of experimental data to evaluate the effects of electrical stimulation on brain signals.
    * __Mentoring:__ Supervising laboratory personnel.

2012-2016
:   *Research Engineer,*  NJIT/Rutgers

    * __System Design:__ Designed and built a data recording system for real time biological and video signal acquisition. Used PTC Pro Engineer to design and print 3D parts as needed. The system monitored a force sensor to automatically detect a behavioral task and store data using a FIFO buffer.
    * __Supervised Learning (Classification):__ Classified forelimb extension and flexion movements using spinal cord signals recorded in rats. LDA, KNN, SVM, Naïve Bayes, and Random Forest algorithms were tested and compared for their classification performance.
    * __Supervised Learning (Regression):__ Forelimb electromyography (EMG) signals were predicted from the spinal cord signals in rats. Multiple Linear Regression algorithm was used.
    * __Image Processing:__ Video images of test subjects (rats) analyzed for movement identification. Custom written MATLAB scripts were used to read and analyze video recordings frame by frame.
    * __Academic:__ Published research papers and presented academic work in national and international conferences. Tutored high school, undergraduate, and graduate students in summer research and school projects.

Spring 2015
:   *Adjunct Instructor,*  The College of New Jersey

    * __Teaching:__ Instructor for 400-level Bioinstrumentation Laboratory. Explained the principles of medical instrumentation such as, sampling, analog and digital signal processing, filtering and noise cancelling.
    * __Laboratory:__ Taught how to use data acquisition systems and software tools to record and process biophysiological signals, such as ECG, EOG, and EMG.
